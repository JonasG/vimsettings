TODO -- Thing I want to learn and do in Vim and Unix

 - Find a way to detect if cygwin is used, so be used for example to decide between using putclip and xsel
 - Is the Vim book from pragprog interesting to buy?
 - Relearn SnipMate. It seems to be broken right now.
 - Add ranger
 - Add my ranger config, cygwin and non-cygwin
 - Add PyDoc and SnipMate to my cheat sheet
 - Ctags support in vim
 - CtrlP + tags
 - cscope
 - Create a program that answers if a file is handles by svn. How can I write a program with boolean output in Unix? Better to write a filter that returns a list of files that are under svn?
